	I was wondering if it's possible to display the widget differently?
	Currently, the nav bar gets way to long when badges are displayed with their title to the right of the image.
	
	5 is about the amount of navbar real estate that I'd like to give up as it becomes too long.
	
	Is it possible to display just the image in a grid-like pattern where a mouse-over alt title is displayed that could take the user to that badge page?
	
	It is just a little cumbersome looking and I'm thinking of an alternate way to display more and more badges without giving away precious nav bar space.

	Hi there,
	
	I would like to have a shortcode and a widget for displaying earners of an achievement.
	
	So if an user provides an achievement's ID in the shortcode / widget, then a list with earners of that corresponding achievement will be displayed.
	
	Display options:
	
		Choice between an ordered or unordered list
		Show username / first name below avatar
		Limit number of earners to be displayed
		Order earners randomly
		Order earners by time
	
	For my site I would really like to use this. MANY thanks in advance. :)
	
	Regards, Sem.
